## NPOpp: Nonprofit and Opportunity Atlas Data Exploration

Hello there!

So excited for you to join me on this project! Here’s the gist:

	Opportunity Atlas has a dataset that shows people’s income by the census tract where they grew up. Another possible source of similar data could come from the National Equity Atlas (I’m not sure yet whether they’re the same).

	The US government tracks all 501c3 nonprofits and has information about their location, their mission (which has a mission code), number of members, and things like that.

	We are setting up an exploratory project to open up questions about how the presence (or persistence) of nonprofits in an area could be related to community improvement. The goal is not to say “Yes, nonprofits cause communities to improve” but to maybe end with some more specific possible research questions or directions.

	
Here are the tools I was planning on using for this analysis:

	The Opportunity Atlas dataset

	Possibly, a National Equity Atlas dataset

	The Exempt Organizations Business Master File (the US government data)

	Python
		The packages I will be using are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit learn. If this is gibberish to you no worries at all, I’ll explain a bit later in your setup tasks what you can do with even some basic coding skills!

	Git
See note above

	Jupyter Notebooks
